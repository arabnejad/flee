Simulation toolkit for the movement of individuals
===========================================================================

Flee is an agent-based modelling toolkit which is purpose-built for simulating the movement of individuals across geographical locations, released under a BSD 3-clause license. 

Flee is currently used for modelling the movements of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). It provides users with the ability to define and use their models through a relatively straightforward application programming interface (API). There are a range of functional tests to allow users to verify the consistency of the code results. FLEE also features a range of scripts to handle and convert data, as well as an automated plotting tool for output generated by the
simulation. 

Flee is publicly available at: https://github.com/djgroen/flee
